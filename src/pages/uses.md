# Uses

If you're like me and you enjoy geeking out over tech, setups, software, equipment and all that then you're probably curious what I use.

## Hat

- Backwards ðŸ˜œ

## Coding

- Editor: [Visual Studio Code (VS Code)]() is my coding editor. If you seen my content in the past you know I'm a huge fan and know a ton about how to use it efficiently.
- Editor Theme: [Night Owl VS Code Theme]()
- Font: Either [Dank Mono]() or [Operator Mono]()
- Terminal: Mostly the built-in terminal for VS Code but otherwise [iTerm]() on Mac or [Windows Terminal]() on Windows
- Terminal Shell: [zsh]() with [oh-my-zsh]()

## Setup

### PC

- Keyboard: Royal Kludge RK84
- Mouse: Corsair M65 Elite - I love this mouse but I've had two now where the left-click switch deteriorates and causes unintentional double clicks
- Monitors: Dell

### Mac

- Macbook Pro 16 inch Mid 2014 model

### Audio/Video/Hardware

- Camera: [Sony a6300 with kit lens]()
- Microphone: [Shure SM7B]()
- Audio Interface: [GoXLR]()
- Lighting: 2x [El Gato Key Light]()
- Greenscreen: Custom built similar to Brian Ketelsen's but I don't believe he has his blog post available anymore that covers the build process.
- El Gato Streamdeck
