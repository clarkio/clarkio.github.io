# Getting Started with Node.js Security with Express and Angular

A few months ago my latest course was released on [Pluralsight](pluralsight.com): [Getting Started with Node.js Security with Express and Angular](https://bit.ly/2cJyxhD). I had a lot of fun putting this course together because it helped draw out the knowledge I've gained over the years building secure web applications. In this course my goal was to share this knowledge in a way that aides others to better comprehend some of the topics within secure application development.

The topics covered in the course are as follows:

1. Cross-site Scripting (XSS)
2. Man in the Middle (MitM)
3. Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF)
4. Clickjacking

Each topic is approached by first showing an attack in action against a sample application, defining the attack, sharing the ways to defend against it and then implementing those defense mechanisms in the sample application. You can find the app [source code on GitHub](https://github.com/clarkio/vulnerable-app).

If you're interested in learning more about secure application development and/or applying such patterns and practices in an AngularJS/Node.js application stack then this course is a great start for you. I hope you enjoy it!
