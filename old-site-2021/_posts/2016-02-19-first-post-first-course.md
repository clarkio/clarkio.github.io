To kick things off, I thought what better way could I start the site than by sharing a quick highlight of my first course published on [Pluralsight](https://app.pluralsight.com).

What I think you'll at least get from this course is a good laugh from the quite corny introduction of myself and see why John Papa keeps calling me [#AngularMan](https://twitter.com/John_Papa/status/652627547377811456). There's also some good content covering how to use this great library called [angular-translate](https://angular-translate.github.io/) which makes it much easier to internationalize an Angular application. Take a look and I hope you enjoy it.
